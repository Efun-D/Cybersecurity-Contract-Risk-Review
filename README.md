# Cybersecurity-Contract-Risk-Review

## Objective
Simulated a cybersecurity-focused legal contract review for a high-risk third-party vendor, identifying gaps in security-related terms and leading a mock negotiation to balance business flexibility with security and regulatory compliance expectations.

### Key Deliverables
- Reviewed and analyzed a sample vendor agreement to identify deficiencies in key cybersecurity clauses (e.g., breach notification, MFA, data handling, subcontractor oversight)
- Performed a gap analysis aligned with NIST, ISO 27001, OSFI B-10, and GDPR requirements
- Simulated a vendor pushback scenario across 6 clauses, with realistic objections reflecting common negotiation constraints
- Drafted a negotiation outcome table showing risk-based clause adjustments and final approved language
- Produced an internal risk memo summarizing risk justification, acceptance rationale, and next steps
- Addressed high-risk areas such as incident notification timeframes, access controls, personnel screening, and contract offboarding
